# Jupyter Notebook version of [CS231n Python Numpy Tutorial](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/)

Preparatory material for the Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition classes at Stanford.

## Material

This repo currently holds:

* A tutorial on basic Python / NumPy that is necesseary to get started with the above machine learning class. The [original tutorial](https://github.com/kuleshov/cs228-material), of which this repo is a fork, still uses Python 2.7. The [original CS231n](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/) follows Python 3.x for the class, so the code in this tutorial uses Python 3.7 and NumPy 1.15. 

You may follow the Jupyter Notebook on GitHub, or clone and execute it locally.
