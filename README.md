# Python / NumPy Tutorial for [Stanford CS class CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/)

Preparatory material for the probabilistic graphical models and the deep learning classes at Stanford.

## Material

This repo currently holds:

* A tutorial on basic Python / NumPy that is necesseary to get started with the above machine learning class. The [original tutorial](https://github.com/kuleshov/cs228-material), of which this repo is a fork, still uses Python 2.7. The [original CS231n](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/) follows Python 3.x for the class, so the code in this tutorial uses Python 3.7 and NumPy 1.15. 

You may follow the Jupyter Notebook on GitHub, or clone and execute it locally.
