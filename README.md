# Jupyter Notebook version of [CS231n Python NumPy Tutorial](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/)

Preparatory material for the Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition classes at Stanford.

## Material

This repo currently holds:

* A tutorial on basic Python, NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib that is necesseary to get started with the above machine learning class. The [original tutorial](https://github.com/kuleshov/cs228-material), of which this repo is a fork, still uses Python 2.7. The [original CS231n](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/) follows Python 3.x for the class, so the code in this fork uses Python 3.7, NumPy 1.15, SciPy 1.1, and Matplotlib 2.2.3. 

You may follow the Jupyter Notebook on GitHub, or clone and execute it locally.
